# Current Version: 4.0.1 

     Important note:  Malwoverview does NOT submit samples to Virus Total or Hybrid Analysis by 
     default. It submits only hashes, so respecting Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs). Nonetheless, 
     if you use the "-V" (uppercase), "-A" (uppercase) or "-P" (uppercase), so Malwoverview SUBMITS your 
     malware sample to Virus Total, Hybrid Analysis and Polyswarm, respectively. Additionally, options 
     "-Y" and "-T" also sent the Android package from Android device to Hybrid-Analysis and Virus 
     Total, respectively.  


# ABOUT

Malwoverview.py is a simple tool to perform an initial and quick triage of malware samples, URLs and hashes. 
Additionally, Malwoverview is able to show some threat intelligence information.   

This tool aims to : 

1. Determine similar executable malware samples (PE/PE+) according to the import table (imphash) and group 
   them by different colors (pay attention to the second column from output). Thus, colors matter!
2. Show hash information on Virus Total, Hybrid Analysis, Malshare, Polyswarm, URLhaus, Alien Vault, i
   Malpedia and ThreatCrowd engines. 
3. Determining whether the malware samples contain overlay and, if you want, extract it. 
4. Check suspect files on Virus Total, Hybrid Analysis and Polyswarm.
5. Check URLs on Virus Total, Malshare, Polyswarm, URLhaus engines and Alien Vault. 
6. Download malware samples from Hybrid Analysis, Malshare, HausURL, Polyswarm and Malpedia engines.
7. Submit malware samples to VirusTotal, Hybrid Analysis and Polyswarm.
8. List last suspected URLs from URLHaus.
9. List last payloads from URLHaus. 
10. Search for specific payloads on the Malshare.
11. Search for similar payloads (PE32/PE32+) on Polyswarm engine.
12. Classify all files in a directory searching information on Virus Total and Hybrid Analysis. 
13. Make reports about a suspect domain using different engines such as VirusTotal, Malpedia and 
    ThreatCrowd. 
14. Check APK packages directly from Android devices against Hybrid Analysis and Virus Total. 
15. Submit APK packages directly from Android devices to Hybrid Analysis and Virus Total. 
16. Show URLs related to an user provided tag from URLHaus.
17. Show payloads related to a tag (signature) from URLHaus.
18. Show information about an IP address from Virus Total, Alien Vault, Malpedia and ThreatCrowd.
19. Show IP address, domain and URL information from Polyswarm. 
21. Perform meta-search on Polyswarm Network using several criteria: imphash, IPv4, domain, URL and
    malware family. 
22. Gather threat hunting information from AlienVault using different criteria. 
23. Gather threat hunting information from Malpedia using different criteria. 
24. Gather threat hunting information from ThreatCrowd using different criteria.

# INSTALLATION 

This tool has been tested on Ubuntu, Kali Linux 2020, REMnux, Windows 8.1 and 10. Malwoverview 
can be installed by executing the following command:

      pip3.8 install git+https://github.com/alexandreborges/malwoverview (preferred method) 
      or...
      python -m pip install -U malwoverview
      or...
      git clone https://github.com/alexandreborges/malwoverview


To use Malwoverview you should insert VirusTotal, Hybrid Analysis, URLHaus, Malshare, Polyswarm,
Alien Vault and Malpedia APIs into the .malwapi.conf configuration file (the default one at the 
home directory -- if the file doesn't exist, so you should create it) or you could create a 
custom configuration file and indicate it by using the -c option. 

A special note about the Alien Vault: it is necessary to subscribe to pulses on Alien Vault 
website before using -n 1 option.  

The .malwapi.conf configuration file (from the the home directory) has the following format: 

      [VIRUSTOTAL]
      VTAPI = 

      [HYBRID-ANALYSIS]
      HAAPI = 

      [MALSHARE]
      MALSHAREAPI = 

      [HAUSSUBMIT]
      HAUSSUBMITAPI = 

      [POLYSWARM]
      POLYAPI = 

      [ALIENVAULT]
      ALIENAPI = 

      [MALPEDIA]
      MALPEDIAAPI =

In Windows systems, when the package is installed using pip, the suggestion is to create the 
.malwapi.conf in either C:\Users\<username> directory.  Additionally, you don't need to specify 
"-w 1" option while using malwoverview.py on Windows anymore. 

To check the installation, execute:

       malwoverview.py --help
       
Further information is available on: 

       (PYPI.org repository) https://pypi.org/project/malwoverview/
       (Github) https://github.com/alexandreborges/malwoverview

If you want to perform the manual steps (usually, it is not necessary), so few steps will be necessary:

## Kali Linux (manual steps)

1. Python version 3.8 or later (Only Python 3.x !!! It does NOT work using Python 2.7) 

       $ apt-get install python3.8  (for example)

2. Python-magic.  

      To install python-magic package you can execute the following command:

       $ pip3.8 install python-magic

      Or compiling it from the github repository:

       $ git clone https://github.com/ahupp/python-magic
       $ cd python-magic/
       $ python3.8 setup.py build
       $ python3.8 setup.py install

      As there are serious problems about existing two versions of python-magic package, my 
      recommendation is to install it from github (second procedure above) and copy the magic.py 
      file to the SAME directory of malwoverview tool. 
      
3. Install several Python packages: 

       $ pip3.8 install -r requirements.txt

       OR

       $ pip3.8 install -U pefile
       $ pip3.8 install -U colorama
       $ pip3.8 install -U simplejson
       $ pip3.8 install -U python-magic
       $ pip3.8 install -U requests
       $ pip3.8 install -U validators
       $ pip3.8 install -U geocoder
       $ pip3.8 install -U polyswarm-api
       $ pip3.8 install -U pathlib
       $ pip3.8 install -U configparser
       
4. To check an Android mobile you need to install the "adb" program by executing the following command:

       # apt get install adb

   PS: before trying Android's options, check:

       * If the adb program is listed in the PATH environment variable.
       * If the system has authorized access to the device by using "adb devices -l"

5. Finally, you can install Malwoverview using one of the following methods:

         pip3.8 install git+https://github.com/alexandreborges/malwoverview (preferred method) 

         or...

         python -m pip install -U malwoverview

         or...

         git clone https://github.com/alexandreborges/malwoverview


## Windows (manual steps)

1. Install the Python version 3.8.x or later from https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/ 

2. Python-magic. 

      To install python-magic package you can execute the following command:

       C:\> python.exe -m pip install python-magic

      Or compiling it from the github repository:

       C:\> git clone https://github.com/ahupp/python-magic
       C:\> cd python-magic/
       C:\> python.exe setup.py build
       C:\> python.exe setup.py install

3. Install several Python packages:

                        Submits a file(up to 32MB) for Virus Total scanning and gets the report. Attention: 
                        use forward slash to specify the target file even on Windows systems. Furthermore, 
                        the minimum waiting time is set up in 90 seconds because the Virus Total waiting 
                        queue. If an error occurs, so wait few minutes and try to access the report by 
                        using -f option.
      -A SUBMIT_HA, --submitha SUBMIT_HA
                        Submits a file(up to 32MB) to be scanned by the Hybrid Analysis engine. Use the 
                        -e option to specify the best environment to run the suspicious file.
      -g HA_STATUS, --hastatus HA_STATUS
                        Checks the report's status of submitted samples to Hybrid Analysis engine by

                        -O option for Polyswarm engine.
      -e HA_ENVIRONMENT, --haenv HA_ENVIRONMENT
                        This option specifies the used environment to be used to test the samlple on 
                        Hybrid Analysis: <0> Windows 7 32-bits; <1> Windows 7 32-bits (with HWP Support); 
                        <2> Windows 7 64-bits; <3> Android; <4> Linux 64-bits environment. This option 
                        is used together either -H option or the -A option.
      -t MULTITHREAD, --thread MULTITHREAD
                        (optional) This option has several different meanings according to chosen the 
                        value. Possible values: <1>: This value is used to force multithreads on Linux 
                        whether: the -d option is specified AND you have a PAID Virus Total API or you
                        are NOT checking the VT while using the -d option. PS1: using this option causes 
                        Imphashes not to be grouped anymore; PS2: it also works on Windows, but there is 
                        not gain in performance; <2>: This value should be used with -d option in
                        two scenarios: 1) either including the "-v 1" option (Virus Total -- you'll see 
                        a complete VT response whether you have the private API) for a multithread searching
                        and reduced output; 2) or including the -a option (Hybrid Analysis) for a multithread 
                        searching to get a complete and amazing output. If you are using the -a option, so 
                        you should pickup the right number represening the testing environment to adjust the 
                        output to your sample types. PS1: certainly, if you have a directory holding 
                        many malware samples, so you will want to test this option with -a option; PS2: it 
                        also works on Windows, but there is not gain in performance; <3>: You should use 
                        this value with -v option if you have a public Virus Total API. It forces a one 
                        minute wait every 4 malware samples, but allows obtaining a complete evaluation of 
                        the malware repository.
      -l MALSHARE_HASHES, --malsharelist MALSHARE_HASHES
                        This option shows hashes of a specific type from the last 24 hours from Malshare

                        13: PDF ; 14: Composite(OLE). You need to insert your Malshare API into the 
                        .malwapi.conf file.
      -L MALSHARE_HASH_SEARCH, --malsharehash MALSHARE_HASH_SEARCH
                        Searches for the provided hash on the Malshare repository. You need to insert your 
                        Malshare API into the .malwapi.conf file. PS: sometimes the Malshare website is 
                        unavailable, so should check the website availability if you get some error message.
      -K HAUS_PAYLOAD_URL, --haus_payloadbatch HAUS_PAYLOAD_URL

                        (Only for Linux) This parameter specifies search type for arguments provided by
                        -R option (above) while searching on Polyswarm engine. Thus, the following values are 
                        valid -- 0: PE Executable (look for samples with the same ImpHash); 1: IP Address ; 
                        2: Domain ; 3. URL; 4. Family
      -y ANDROID_HA, --androidha ANDROID_HA
                        This option has multiple options: <1>: Check all third-party APK packages from the 
                        USB-connected Android device against Hybrid Analysis using multithreads. The Android 
                        device does not need to be rooted and the system does need to
                        have the adb tool in the PATH environment variable; <2>: Check all third-party APK 
                        packages from the USB-connected
                        Android device against VirusTotal using Public API (slower because of 60 seconds delay 
                        for each 4 hashes). The Android device does not need to be rooted and the system does 
                        need to have adb tool in the PATH environment variable; <3>: Check all third-party 
                        APK packages from the USB-connected Android device against VirusTotal using 
                        multithreads (only for Private Virus API). The Android device does not need to be 
                        rooted and the system needs to have adb tool in the PATH environment variable.

                        Provides argument to AlienVault -n option.The allowed values are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
      -M MALPEDIA, --malpedia MALPEDIA
                        This option is related to MALPEDIA and presents different meanings depending on the 
                        chosen value. Thus, 1: List meta information for all families ; 2: List all actors 
                        ID ; 3: List all available payloads organized by family from Malpedia; 4: Get meta 
                        information from an specific actor, so it is necessary to use the -m option. 
                        Additionally, try to confirm the correct actor ID by executing malwoverview with 
                        option -M 3; 5: List all families IDs; 6: Get meta information from an specific 
                        family, so it is necessary to use the -m option. Additionally, try to confirm the 
                        correct family ID by executing malwoverview with option -M 5; 7: Get a malware 
                        sample from malpedia (zip format -- password: infected). It is necessary to specify 
                        the requested hash by using -m option; 8: Get a zip file containing Yara rules for 
                        a specific family (get the possible families using -M 5), which must be specified 
                        by using -m option.
      -m MALPEDIAARG, --malpediarg MALPEDIAARG
                        This option provides an argument to the -M option, which is related to MALPEDIA.
      -Q THREATCROWD, --threatcrowd THREATCROWD
                        Checks multiple information from ThreatCrowd. The possible values are: 1: Get 
                        information about the provided e-mail ;
                        2: Get information about an IP address; 3: Get information about a domain; 4: Get 
                        information about a provided MD5 hash; 5: Get information about a specific malware 
                        family.
      -q THREATCROWDARG, --threatcrowdarg THREATCROWDARG
                        This option provides an argument to the -Q option, which is related to THREATCROWD.

      Remember that public VT API only allows 4 searches per second (as shown at the image above). Therefore,
      if you are willing to wait some minutes, so you can use the -p option, which forces a one minute wait 
      every 4 malware samples, but allows obtaining a complete evaluation of the repository.


      * ATTENTION 1: if the directory contains many malware samples while using -d option, so malwoverview.py
                     could take some time. Nonetheless, you can use the new -t option (multithreading) to
                     speed-up things. :)
         
      ** ATTENTION 2: All engines enforces quota of submission and/or verification per day and/or month. 
                      Take care!
       
      *** ATTENTION 3: Some options searching on Hybrid Analysis strongly depend of the "-e" option, which 
                       specifies the environment. Therefore, to check an Android sample (for example) it is 
                       necessary to use the right environment (-e 3 for Android).

# HISTORY

Version 4.0.1:

      This version:

            * Fixes small typos and the README. 


Version 4.0.0:

      This version:

            * Introduces new engines such as Alien Vault, Malpedia and ThreatCrowd. 
            * The -s option has been removed. Use -v 2 option for antivirus report.
            * The -n option is not longer associated to Malshare. Use -l option with 
              values between 1 and 14.
            * To specify the hash in Malshare use the L option instead of -m option. 
            * The -i option has been removed. Use the -v 3 option for IAT/EAT. 
            * The -a option has been changed to include the system environments in Hybrid 
              Analysis. However, the -e option has been kept to be used with other options. 
            * The -M option is not longer responsible for downloading samples in Malshare. Use
              -D option for this task. 
            * The -B option for list URLs from URLHaus has been replaced by -K 2 option. 
            * The -Z and -X options (related to Android) have been replaced for -y 2 and -y 3, 
              respectively. 
            * The -D option (download a malware sample) has been extended to Polyswarm. 
            * The malware sample's DLL list has been introduced. 
            * The -R and -G options from Polyswarm have been completely fixed. Additionally, both
              ones also include the polyscore in the output. 
            * The -N option is not longer associated to Polyswarm .
